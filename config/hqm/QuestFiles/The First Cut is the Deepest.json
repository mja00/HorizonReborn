To use it, make a sacrificial knife and right click it near the altar.  This will hurt you for 1 heart and fill the altar by 200LP.  Keep right clicking till you have 2000LP in the altar, then right click a diamond on the filled altar.  You will see particles, and after a while, the diamond will absorb the 2000LP you put in, and become a weak blood orb.  Once you have that, right-click to bind it to you with a little health.  You will now be able to slot the orb into a altar, whereupon it will suck the blood into your soul network, where it can be used for everything else related to the mod.  PSA - there\u0027s no way to get the blood back into the altar, so be careful!",
